The programs contained in this folder are used to implement a simple list of instructions for solving a Tower of Hanoi puzzle with a given number of disks (hanoi.py), and 
a program for printing the inorder and preorder traversals of a tree input to the program as an array of integers or null values (tree.py)

Both programs can easily be run from within your Python IDE of choice without modification, or directly run on the command line using the appropriate Python 3 command with
no additionalarguments.
