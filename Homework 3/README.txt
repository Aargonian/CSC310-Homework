My Homework3 consists of a single source file, Main.java, which can easily be compiled and run on the command line
with the following commands:

~$ javac Main.java
~$ java Main

Alternatively, it can be loaded into any compatible Java IDE. The source should work for any version of Java above
version 7, due to the use of generics and the reflection API.
